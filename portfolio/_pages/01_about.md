My name is Alexes Presswood. I am a developer from St. Louis currently residing in Kansas City. I started programming mobile
applications in my free time because once I graduated college from the University of Missouri, I realized I had a passion for 
mobile development.

This website is used to document what I have learned, and what I am currently learning. This site is always in progress;
I am making it better as I grow as a programmer.

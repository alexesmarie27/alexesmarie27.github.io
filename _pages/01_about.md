Hi! My name is Alexes Presswood. I am a developer from St. Louis currently
residing in Kansas City. I started programming mobile applications in my free
time because once I graduated college from the University of Missouri, I
realized I had a passion for mobile development.

This website is used to document what I have learned, and what I am currently
learning. This site is always in progress; I am making it better as I grow as
a developer.

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<p>I like to work on several things at one time so that I can work on whatever
is inspiring me at the time. The following list are projects I am actively
working on (NOTE: all names are not the final names, so don't judge my lack of
creativity when naming apps):</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/alexesmarie27/MissedConnections">Missed
        Connections</a> An Android application inspired from the Craigslist
        section with the same name. A form of dating website where you
        connect with the people you see during your normal activities. This
        project is written in Java currently, but I am transitioning it over to
        Kotlin. Another future project stemming off of this one is to write
        the project over again, only for iOS in Swift.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/alexesmarie27/Adopter">Adopter</a> An
        Android application that will connect animals in animal shelters to
        families wanting to adopt in the nearby area. This app is being
        written in Kotlin. This app will also eventually be written in Swift.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/alexesmarie27/HappyHourFinder">Happy Hour
        Finder</a> An Android application that will show food, drink, and
        attraction specials and happy hours in the local area depending on
        the day. Written in Java, then Swift.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/alexesmarie27/alexesmarie27.github.io">This
        Website</a> This site was a way for me to try out Github Pages and
        Jekyll, both of which I had never used before. As I said earlier,
        this website is a work in progress. It started as a way for me to
        dapple in Github Pages and Jekyll. This site is in no way perfect or
        complete. I feel like there is more to learn from these technologies,
        and also some definite UI updates.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Projects</h3>
<p>There are several different projects I have in my mental backlog. My next
project will be to create a blog from scratch, possibly using React as a way to
learn the javascript library. And of course I have many mobile apps in mind,
one of which being a wine app that utilizes gamification for trying many
different bottles of wine.</p>
<p>The list is forever growing, but personal projects are a way for me to
practice languages and technologies that I haven't been exposed to yet or
ones that I haven't used enough. I create technology that interests me, that
I would use in my normal life, or that I think would make something in my own
personal life easier.

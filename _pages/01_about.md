Hi! My name is Alexes Presswood. I am a developer from St. Louis currently
residing in Kansas City. I started programming mobile applications in my free
time because once I graduated college from the University of Missouri, I
realized I had a passion for mobile development.

This website is used to document what I have learned, and what I am currently
learning. This site is always in progress; I am making it better as I grow as
a developer.
